        "description": "FizzBuzz is one of the most well-known problems from coding interviews. In this problem, we will consider a remixed version of FizzBuzz: Given an integer n , process all integers from 0 to n . For every integer such that its remainders modulo 3 and modulo 5 are the same (so, for every integer i such that i mod 3 = i mod 5 ), print FizzBuzz . However, you don't have to solve it. Instead, given the integer n , you have to report how many times the correct solution to that problem will print FizzBuzz .",

        "description": "2070A - FizzBuzz RemixedThe key observation in this problem is that, if you pick two integers xx and x+15x+15, both their remainders modulo 33 and modulo 55 are the same. So, the number of integers we need to count in [0,14][0,14] is the same as in [15,29][15,29], the same as in [30,44][30,44], and so on.So, you can calculate the number of segments of length 1515 starting from 00 before nn (which is ⌊n15⌋⌊n15⌋), multiply it by the number of values we need in [0,14][0,14], and then process the last (partial) segment naively, since it will contain at most 1515 elements.Time complexity: O(1)O(1).",
