        "description": "For any n, Cube can set a = any integer between 1 and n−1 inclusive, and set b=n−a. a cannot be less than 1, because then it would be non-positive, and a cannot be greater than n−1, because then b would be less than 1, which would make it non-positive. Therefore the answer is just n−1 for all n.",
