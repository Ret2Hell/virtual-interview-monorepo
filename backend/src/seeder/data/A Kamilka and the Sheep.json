        "title": "Kamilka and the Sheep",
        "description": "Kamilka has a flock of n n sheep, the i i -th of which has a beauty level of a i a i . All a i a i are distinct. Morning has come, which means they need to be fed. Kamilka can choose a non-negative integer d d and give each sheep d d bunches of grass. After that, the beauty level of each sheep increases by d d . In the evening, Kamilka must choose exactly two sheep and take them to the mountains. If the beauty levels of these two sheep are x x and y y (after they have been fed), then Kamilka's pleasure from the walk is equal to gcd ( x , y ) gcd ( x , y ) , where gcd ( x , y ) gcd ( x , y ) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x x and y y . The task is to find the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.",
        "input_specification": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤5001≤t≤500), the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (2≤n≤1002≤n≤100), the number of sheep Kamilka has. The second line of each test case contains nn distinct integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109)a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the beauty levels of the sheep.It is guaranteed that all aiai are distinct.",
        "output_specification": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.",

        "description": "First of all, it can be observed that for any two sheep with beauty levels x<yx<y, the maximum possible pleasure cannot exceed y−xy−x, since gcd(x,y)=gcd(x,y−x)gcd(x,y)=gcd(x,y−x).Secondly, we can choose x=min(a)x=min(a), y=max(a)y=max(a), and d=−xmod(y−x)d=−xmod(y−x), achieving a pleasure of max(a)−min(a)max(a)−min(a).Thus, the answer is max(a)−min(a)max(a)−min(a).",
